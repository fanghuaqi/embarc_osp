Getting Started
===============

Use this guide to get started with your :ref:`embARC OSP <introduction_embarc_osp>`
development.

Checking Out the embARC OSP Code
################################

The embARC OSP source code is hosted in a GitHub repository that supports
cloning via git. There are scripts and such in this repo that you'll need to set up your development environment, and we'll be using Git to get this repo. If you don't have Git installed, see the beginning of the OS-specific instructions below for help.

We'll begin by using Git to clone the repository anonymously.

.. code-block:: console

   # On Windows
   cd %userprofile%
   # On Linux
   cd ~

   git clone https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/embarc_osp.git embarc_osp

You have successfully checked out a copy of the source code to your local
machine.

Set Up the Development Environment
##################################

The embARC supports these operating systems.

* Microsoft Windows 10 / Windows 7
* Ubuntu 16.04

Use the following procedure to create a new development environment.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   software_requirement.rst

.. note:: The embARC OSP uses make/gmake as a build tool. They are provided in the ARC development tools.

Building a Sample Application
#############################

Using the ``blinky`` as a base model, the following section will describe how
to build a embARC OSP application. The following sections contain the commands
of using ARC GNU toolchain in a Windows environment. Please use the
appropriate commands for your OS.

Follow these steps to build a sample application.

1. Make sure the ARC GNU toolchain is installed in your environment, see :ref:`software_requirement`.

2. Navigate to :ref:`example_blinky` example located at embARC OSP directory.

.. code-block:: console

   cd embarc_osp\example\baremetal\blinky

3. Build the :ref:`example_blinky` example for the EMSK 2.3 board and ARC EM11D.

.. code-block:: console

   make TOOLCHAIN=gnu BOARD=emsk BD_VER=23 CUR_CORE=arcem11d

.. note:: **make** for ARC GNU toolchain, **gmake** for MetaWare toolkit

Hardware Preparation
####################

Use the following procedures to prepare ARC boards to run/debug the embARC applications.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   getting_started_with_em_starter_kit.rst
   getting_started_with_hs_development_kit.rst

See the following procedures to check peripherals and board settings. The peripherals are not required for all the embARC examples.

Running a Sample Application
############################

Follow these steps to run a sample application.

#. Make sure the *blinky* example has been built successfully in :ref:`building_a_sample_application`. Get the .elf file ``blinky_gnu_arcem11d.elf`` in ``<blinky>\obj_emsk_23\gnu_arcem11d``.

#. Follow to steps in :ref:`getting_started_with_em_starter_kit` to set and connect EMSK 2.3 with EM11D to your local machine.

#. Navigate to the embARC OSP directory and run :ref:`example_blinky` example.

.. code-block:: console

   cd embarc_osp\example\baremetal\blinky
   make TOOLCHAIN=gnu BOARD=emsk BD_VER=23 CUR_CORE=arcem11d run

.. note:: No peripheral modules are required to run ``blinky`` example.
